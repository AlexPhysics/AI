# AI

Skills involved:
- Backend engineering (played with API's from BING chatbot and OpenAi)
- Text-to-Speech (real time)
- Speech-to-Text (real time)
- Used AWS to centralize everything
- The project is still raw but is funny to play back-forth with NLP's and OpenAI models.

Developed a Virtual Assistant with AI. 

The present work is a developed, fully functional, absolutelly free Virtual Assistant based on ChatGPT 3.5 and Bing AI API's.

It is sufficiently smart to generate reponses (the exact same way ChatGPT would do it), and the beauty of it is that ChatGPT doesn't have up-to-date data, so I mixed Bing AI for the most recent data in order to fulfill the gap.
