Developing a Virtual Assistant with AI.

The present work is a developed, fully functional, absolutelly free Virtual Assistant based on ChatGPT 3.5 and Bing AI API's.

It is sufficiently smart to generate reponses (the exact same way ChatGPT would do it), and the beauty of it is that ChatGPT doesn't have up-to-date data, so I mixed Bing AI for the most recent data in order to fulfill the gap.
